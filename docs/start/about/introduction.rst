BakeMaster is an add-on specified for baking various texture maps and created for Blender - open-source 3D Computer graphics software. Along with its intuitive and convenient workflow baking process becomes a pleasure.

An unlimited number of objects and custom maps, each driven by unique settings - all can be configured and baked with BakeMaster!

Why Artists choose BakeMaster
=============================

|list_of_maps|

Baking standard Cycles maps is straightforward, but what about baking dozens of them, or PBR-based that are highly relevant in physically accurate texturing? This can easily lead to losing valuable time. Having taken advantage of Blender's node-based material system, we decided to create a fast, responsive, and comfortable baking solution alongside the native baking operator.

BakeMaster makes the whole process easy to tweak and delivers more functionalities.

Never worry about the nodes again: just toggle a couple of settings and BakeMaster will configure it all for you. Cycles maps are gone? Not just yet - simpler UI and manageable settings make it feel cool.

For whom is BakeMaster?
=======================

Baking is yours. BakeMaster is yours.

| BakeMaster is a baking add-on. It is made to fit beginners as well as proficient users. 
| It allows you to bake crucial and special maps that can be fully controlled uniquely.

Whether you fall into baking rarely, or it is your regular workflow, BakeMaster will cover you. It is vital to have comfortable creation tools to save yourself time, and with which your artistic thoughts will never jump out of the boat.
