================
Creation Process
================

BakeMaster is built on Blender Python API. It uses a native Blender baking operator for baking PBR-based maps, default Blender Cycles maps, and special mask maps. The add-on emits and advances Blender's baking process, making it a top-notch solution for any scene setup.

History
=======

First steps along
-----------------

In August of 2021, the first idea about creating a baking add-on appeared. We wanted to improve standalone Blender's baking workflow and adjust it to be comfortable, convenient and easy to use for any user on any level. It all started with a simple structure concept:

* Mesh object as a 'holder' for the maps to be baked.

The concept was great, but the build was left on a dusty shelf and had not been touched for a long.

Active development
------------------

The active development of BakeMaster started around May 2022. At that moment, we were inspired to continue working and get the add-on finished. Having pulled up the old concepts, we were satisfied with the direction where to move next and, being fulfilled with new skills and knowledge, decided to take it seriously.

We improved the design structure and replanned it with new features and functionality added to Blender. From there, the BakeMaster felt its niche being lifted.

Present days
------------

Even now, though BakeMaster Blender Add-on has been officially released, it is still under active development and improvement. The add-on latest release version is fully stable and ready to use. And our team is on its way to supporting BakeMaster with features and functionality users love and desire.
