Uninstall previous versions
===========================

If you have a previous version of BakeMaster running in Blender,
installing a new one might cause runtime errors on registering,
so follow the steps to uninstall it first:

1. Open Blender
2. Go to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons
3. Type "BakeMaster" into the search bar
4. Expand the add-on panel and click "Remove"
5. Save Blender Preferences

It would be good to restart Blender after for changes to take into effect.

Download the latest version
===========================

Download the latest BakeMaster add-on version from the **Blender Market** or **Gumroad**.
We recommend installing the latest one, as we deliver stability and functionality improvements with each new version.

A demo version can be also installed from the `GitHub repo <https://github.com/KirilStrezikozin/BakeMaster-Blender-Addon>`__:
Go to the ``install/`` directory and download a zip folder.
See `BakeMaster Versions <https://bakemaster-blender-addon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/versions/versions.html>`__ for the difference between the Demo and the Full version.

After downloading a zipped add-on folder, **do not unzip** it.
Go to your Blender Preferences and install it. The add-on folder can be then accessed within Blender's ``scripts/addons/`` directory after.

1. Open Blender
2. Go to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons
