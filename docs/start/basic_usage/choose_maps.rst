Additional Tips
===============

About map types
---------------

Map Pass type can be set by clicking the name of the map in the List of Maps table. You can choose a map pass type within the 25 types available. 

.. note:: 
    An object in the List of Objects can have an unlimited number of maps added.

.. note:: 
    You can add map passes of the same map pass type. For example, you can bake three Albedo maps, each with unique settings.

Bake visibility
---------------

If you have prepared some maps for the future and you don't want to bake them alongside others, click the "üì∑ Camera" button near the map pass to toggle its "bake visibility". You can then get back to those maps and bake them too.
