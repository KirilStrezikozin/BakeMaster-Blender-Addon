Apply Lastly Edited Setting
===========================

Sometimes, you can have many maps or objects, and there's one specific setting you need to be similar. It's always possible to click a couple of times to set it, but BakeMaster has a cool feature to save you time: ``Apply Lastly Edited Setting`` located in the Bake panel.
