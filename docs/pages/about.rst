Why creators choose BakeMaster
==============================

Baking standardly with Blender is ok. But what about baking dozens of models with a desire to have different settings, maps, masks, or view how baked maps will look like, make sure your objects have a correct shading set up, perform a Channel Pack, or any other highly requested task? It can easily lead to losing valuable time.
Here is when BakeMaster comes into play. It can manage all of that in seconds and with a few clicks!

Have complex materials? Never worry about the nodes again: toggle a couple of settings, and BakeMaster will configure it all for you. Are Cycles maps gone? Not just yet - simple UI and manageable settings make it feel better.
