Introduction
============

Welcome to BakeMaster, a powerful and feature-packed baking solution created for Blender - an open-source 3D Computer graphics software.

Along with the BakeMaster's intuitive and convenient workflow baking process becomes a pleasure. The addon is for users who can't stand wasting time and yearn for most functionality with professional and cutting-edge baking features.

With it, baking feels like a new book. Everything is right in your hands, under control, and easy to access and configure. Created by artists, BakeMaster is straightforward and comfortable to use, yet lands with numerous tweaks and toggles to fully meet your ultimate texture baking preferences.

Baking with BakeMaster takes only three steps:

* Setup Objects
* Choose Maps
* Hit Bake!

An unlimited number of objects and maps to bake, each driven by unique or grouped settings - carry it all out with BakeMaster!

Why creators choose BakeMaster
==============================

Baking standardly with Blender is ok. But what about baking dozens of models with a desire to have different settings, maps, masks, or view how baked maps will look like, make sure your objects have a correct shading set up, perform a Channel Pack, or any other highly requested task? It can easily lead to losing valuable time.
Here is when BakeMaster comes into play. It can manage all of that in seconds and with a few clicks!

Have complex materials? Never worry about the nodes again: toggle a couple of settings, and BakeMaster will configure it all for you. Are Cycles maps gone? Not just yet - simple UI and manageable settings make it feel cool.

                        I used to dread the baking part because of the confusing specificity, so most of my models ended up unfinished. But now I bake like a master!
