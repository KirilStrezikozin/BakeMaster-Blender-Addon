About me
========

I am a programmer, artist, and enthusiast who loves making visualized things real.
As a proficient blender user for over 3 years, the baking niche has always set me up to recreate it. Therefore, here I am with the start of its journey: BakeMaster. With its release, I yearn for bringing what users have been expecting for so long - a pleasant baking experience.

The Product
===========

The product: BakeMaster is your Freedom to Bake, an ultimate Baking solution for Blender. It allows you to Bake PBR, Default Cycles, and Special Maps with ultra ease and comfort. Make your baking process become a pleasure.

Product introduction
====================

BakeMaster is an add-on specified for baking various texture maps. Along with its intuitive and convenient workflow baking process becomes a pleasure. Built from scratch for users who can’t stand wasting time, and yearn for most functionality and cutting-edge features.
With BakeMaster, baking feels like a new book.

Everything is right in your hands, under control, and easy to access and configure. Created by artists, BakeMaster is simple, straightforward, and convenient for comfortable use, yet lands with numerous tweaks and toggles to fully meet your ultimate texture baking preferences.

We gave our best shot to make you love the setup in BakeMaster, which takes only 3 steps:
- add meshes
- add maps
- set and hit Bake!

An unlimited number of objects and custom maps, each driven by unique settings - all can be configured and baked with BakeMaster!

Why choose BakeMaster?
======================

Baking standard Cycles maps is straightforward, but what about baking dozens of them, or PBR-based that are highly relevant in physically accurate texturing? This can easily lead to losing valuable time. Having taken advantage of Blender’s node-based material system, we decided to create a fast, responsive, and comfortable baking solution alongside the native baking operator.

BakeMaster makes the whole process easy to tweak and delivers more functionalities.

Never worry about the nodes again: just toggle a couple of settings and BakeMaster will configure it all for you. Cycles maps are gone? Not just yet - simpler UI and manageable settings make it feel cool.

Roadmap
=======

The plan I stick to regarding the BakeMaster release:
1. Addon release on the market.
2. Updates, community connect and support.
3. Baking engine development.

I am an artist and content creator. I use Blender for creating 3d, especially: Concepts, Characters, Environments, and Architecture design.

I am planning to submit a backing add-on - BakeMaster. It uses a native Blender baking operator for baking unique texture maps, each driven by bake settings and configured by material nodes. I decided to group and provide the bake settings that would be comfortable for beginners and proficient users, with different bake output requests.
More details can be viewed in the documentation: https://bakemaster-blender-addon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

I am submitting the add-on with the blend file and several assets from the demo video for users to tweak and get to know the add-on. The goal is:

1. Make the baking process for new users more straightforward by giving user-friendly instructions and separating advanced settings into separate groups of panels.
2. Give an ability to bake faster with organization units and bake previews.
3. Deliver advanced bake control by setting unique settings for each map and object.
4. Provide support and inspiration for users with workflow and creation descriptions for their development.
