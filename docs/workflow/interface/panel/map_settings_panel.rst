Particular Map Settings Panel
=============================

Each added map can have unique settings. They are divided into the following groups:

Map Pass Type
-------------

Map Pass Type is a type of the map to be baked. There are 3 categories:

* PBR-based maps
* Default Cycles maps
* Special mask maps
  
There are 25 map types available in total. Each map pass type bake result is different, as well as its settings. You can read and view all the information about each map pass type and map passes in the Maps Workflow.

Map Pass Type can be set by clicking the name of the map in the List of Maps table.

.. note:: 
    An object in the List of Objects can have an unlimited number of maps added.

.. note:: 
    You can add map passes of the same map pass type. For example, you can bake three Albedo maps, each with unique settings.

* File format
* Resolution
* Margin
* Use 32bit float bit depth
* Use Alpha Channel
* Map Denoising
* Affect by Source (apply Source to Target settings for this map pass)
* Other settings that depend on the Blender version you are using

Real-time Map Preview
*********************

Special Maps have a toggle to preview the bake result using Blender Material Shader Nodes. The preview is only available with Cycles Render Engine enabled. 

.. note:: 
    Map Preview will add its custom nodes to preview the map. After toggling off the preview, all of those nodes will be removed without a single touch to the object's initial materials.
