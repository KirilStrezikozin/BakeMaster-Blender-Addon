Building the Add-on
===================

To view the add-on in the Blender application:

1. Navigate to the add-on's directory folder
2. Copy the folder
3. Paste the folder into your Blender's :file:`/addons/` root
4. Restart Blender and enable the add-on in the Blender Preferences.

.. tip:: 
    You can place your project working directory into the Blender's :file:`/addons/` root right at the start to edit and see the changes faster.
