        Introduction
    </a>
</h2>

BakeMaster is a Blender add-on that is built on Blender Python API. It uses a native Blender baking operator for baking PBR-based maps, default Blender Cycles maps, and special mask maps.

The add-on emits and advances Blender's baking process, making it a powerful, fully-featured and one-place solution for any scene setup.

Created by artists, BakeMaster is simple, straightforward and convenient for comfortable use, yet lands with numerous tweaks and toggles to fully meet your ultimate texture baking preferences.

We gave our best shot to make you love the setup in BakeMaster, which takes only 3 steps:
- add meshes
- add maps
- set and hit Bake!

An unlimited number of objects and custom maps, each driven by unique settings - all can be configured and baked with BakeMaster!

<!-- Basic usage steps aka instructions -->
<h2 id="basic-usage">
    <a href="#contents">
        Basic Usage
    </a>
</h2>

Below are the basic steps about how to quickly set up and get the hang of BakeMaster. <br /> If you want to dive into every setting or toggle and become a complete BakeMaster master, <br /> you can visit <a href="">Documentation</a> or watch a <a href="">Video Tutorial</a>.

List of actions:

1. [Choose objects](#1-choose-objects)
2. [Source-target Settings](#2-source-target-settings)
3. [UV Settings](#3-uv-settings)
4. [Choose maps](#4-choose-maps)
5. [Map Settings](#5-map-settings)
6. [Bake Settings](#6-bake-settings)
7. [Baking process](#7-baking-process)

### 1. Choose objects

First of all, you need to choose the objects you want to perform bake for:

> 1. Select objects in the scene
> 2. Press the "Add" button on the BakeMaster panel

As long as objects are added to the list, you can configure their settings.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KirilStrezikozin/BakeMaster-Blender-Addon/master/.github/images/docs/bakemaster-addon-list-adding-objects.gif" alt="bakemaster-addon-list-adding-objects"/>

Tip: to quickly find the object you have added to the list in the outliner, just simply click it in the List of Objects, and it will be selected in the scene.

<a href="">Read more about List of Objects ðŸ“–</a>

### 2. Source-target Settings

If you want to bake high-poly model details onto a low-poly model, <br /> use Source to Target settings:

> 1. Add both low and high-poly models to the List of Objects
> 2. Select the low-poly in the List
> 3. Expand Item Settings panel
> 4. Expand Source to Target panel
> 5. Check "Target"; set "Source" to be the high-poly.

Extrusion, Max Ray Distance and Cage object can be configured inside the Source to Target panel as well.

<a href="">Read more about Source-target Settings ðŸ“–</a>

### 3. UV Settings

If you want to bake to UDIM tiles, or include an object in UV Pack, <br /> the UV Maps panel is essential:

> 1. Select the object in the List of Objects
> 2. Expand Item Settings panel
> 3. Expand UV Maps panel

Inside the panel, you can choose:

> - Active UV layer
> - UV type (Single tile or UDIMs)
> - UV Packing settings

If your object has no UVs, BakeMaster will auto-unwrap the mesh for you before baking.

<a href="">Read more about UV Settings ðŸ“–</a>

### 4. Choose maps

Add maps you would like to be baked in the Map Settings panel:

> 1. Select the object in the List of Objects
> 2. Expand Map Settings panel
> 3. Click the "+" button to add a map pass
> 4. Click on the map pass to set its type

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KirilStrezikozin/BakeMaster-Blender-Addon/master/.github/images/docs/bakemaster-addon-item-add-maps.gif" alt="bakemaster-addon-item-add-maps"/>

If you have prepared some maps for the future and you don't want to bake them alongside others, <br /> click the "ðŸ“·" button near the map pass to toggle its "bake visibility".

<a href="">Read more about Maps ðŸ“–</a>

### 5. Map Settings

Every map pass can have unique output settings. <br /> All of them can be configured inside the Map Pass Settings panel:

> 1. Select the object in the List of Objects
> 2. Expand Map Settings panel
> 3. Choose an active map pass
> 4. Expand the Map Pass Settings panel

Map pass output settings include:

> - File format
> - Resolution
> - Margin
> - Use 32bit float bit depth
> - Use Alpha Channel
> - Map Denoising
> - Affect by Source (apply Source to Target settings for this map pass)
> - Other settings that depend on Blender version

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KirilStrezikozin/BakeMaster-Blender-Addon/master/.github/images/docs/bakemaster-addon-item-map-settings.gif" alt="bakemaster-addon-item-map-settings"/>

Some map passes like AO, Thickness, Displacement and <a href="">others</a> can have custom settings. <br /> They can be also set inside the Map Pass Settings panel.

For example, Curvature Map has the following custom properties <br /> (These settings can be toggled by unchecking "Default" inside the Map Pass Settings panel):

> - Samples count (quality)
> - Radius (edge radius)
> - Edge contrast
> - Body contrast
> - Invert option

<a href="">Special maps</a> have a "Preview" toggle to turn on real-time map preview in the Viewport.

### 6. Bake Settings

Last but not least is the Item Bake Settings panel:

> 1. Select the object in the List of Objects
> 2. Expand Bake Settings panel
> 3. Expand Item Bake Settings panel

Each object in the List of Objects can have custom Bake Settings, including:

> - Material creation (create a material with all baked maps)
> - Internal/External output
> - Output directory and subfolder creation options for External save
> - Maps Batch naming (map naming keywords)
> - Bake device (CPU, GPU - depends on the system)
> - Adaptive sampling, sampling
> - And more

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KirilStrezikozin/BakeMaster-Blender-Addon/master/.github/images/docs/bakemaster-addon-item-bake-settings.gif" alt="bakemaster-addon-item-bake-settings"/>

Inside the same Bake Settings panel, there are several important controls to know about:

> - Reset BakeMaster option (reset BakeMaster after bake)
> - Bake This Button (bake maps only for the current item in the List)
> - Bake All Button (bake maps for all items)

There is also an embossed field called "Bake Instruction". <br /> When you hover over it, you will see Baking process information and controls.

### 7. Baking process

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KirilStrezikozin/BakeMaster-Blender-Addon/master/.github/images/docs/bakemaster-addon-item-baking-progress.gif" alt="bakemaster-addon-item-baking-progress"/>

The baking process can be controlled from your keyboard or Blender Console. <br /> All keybindings are presented under the "Bake Instruction" field inside the Bake Settings panel.

> - Press `BACKSPACE` to cancel baking all next maps
> - Press `ESC` to cancel baking current map
> - Press `BACKSPACE + ESC` to cancel baking

If you want to undo the bake result, press `Ctrl + Z` just after it has been finished or canceled.

BakeMaster process flow is described below:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KirilStrezikozin/BakeMaster-Blender-Addon/master/.github/images/flows/bakemaster-addon-process-flow-full-diagram.png" alt="bakemaster-addon-process-flow-full-diagram" width="900px"/>

BakeMaster keeps track of all added maps and objects in a stack-like order:

> - Item0
>   - Map0
>   - Map1
> - Item3
>   - Map0
> - Item2
>   - Map0
>   - Map1

The order of classes can be changed using the <a href="">order controls</a>. <br />Each class has its unique settings.

BakeMaster picks an Object added to the <a href="">List of Objects</a> and bakes maps added to it one by one. <br /> This process can be shown in the following diagram:

BakeMaster shows baking progress in the bottom info bar, in the style:

```
    Baking [Object Name]: [Map Name], map [Current Map Index] of [Length of Maps] ... [Map Baking Progress]
```
