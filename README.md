<!-- Introduction aka short description -->

    <a href="#contents">
        Introduction
    </a>
</h2>

BakeMaster is a Blender add-on that is built on Blender Python API. It uses a native Blender baking operator for baking PBR-based maps, default Blender Cycles maps, and special mask maps.

The add-on emits and advances Blender's baking process, making it a powerful, fully-featured and one-place solution for any scene setup.

Created by artists, BakeMaster is simple, straightforward and convenient for comfortable use, yet lands with numerous tweaks and toggles to fully meet your ultimate texture baking preferences.

We gave our best shot to make you love the setup in BakeMaster, which takes only 3 steps:
- add meshes
- add maps
- set and hit Bake!

An unlimited number of objects and custom maps, each driven by unique settings - all can be configured and baked with BakeMaster!

<!-- why to choose bakemaster -->
<h2 id="why">
    <a href="#contents">
        Why Artists choose BakeMaster
    </a>
</h2>

Baking standard Cycles maps is straightforward, but what about baking dozens of them, or PBR-based that are highly relevant in physically accurate texturing? This can easily lead to losing valuable time. Having taken advantage of Blender's node-based material system, we decided to create a fast, responsive, and comfortable baking solution alongside the native baking operator.

BakeMaster makes the whole process easy to tweak and delivers more functionalities.

Never worry about the nodes again: just toggle a couple of settings and BakeMaster will configure it all for you. Cycles maps are gone? Not just yet - simpler UI and manageable settings make it feel like a new book.

<a href="https://bakemaster-blender-addon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start/basic_usage/choose_objects.html">Read more about List of Objects ðŸ“–</a>

### 2. Source-target Settings

If you want to bake high-poly model details onto a low-poly model, <br /> use Source to Target settings:

> 1. Add both low and high-poly models to the List of Objects
> 2. Select the low-poly in the List
> 3. Expand Item Settings panel
> 4. Expand Source to Target panel
> 5. Check "Target"; set "Source" to be the high-poly.

Extrusion, Max Ray Distance and Cage object can be configured inside the Source to Target panel as well.

Some map passes like AO, Thickness, Displacement and <a href="https://bakemaster-blender-addon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workflow/map/map.html#map-type">others</a> can have custom settings. <br /> They can be also set inside the Map Pass Settings panel.

For example, Curvature Map has the following custom properties <br /> (These settings can be toggled by unchecking "Default" inside the Map Pass Settings panel):

> - Samples count (quality)
> - Radius (edge radius)
> - Edge contrast
> - Body contrast
> - Invert option

<a href="https://bakemaster-blender-addon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workflow/map/map.html#special-masks">Special maps</a> have a "Preview" toggle to turn on real-time map preview in the Viewport.

### 6. Bake Settings

Last but not least is the Item Bake Settings panel:

> 1. Select the object in the List of Objects
> 2. Expand Bake Settings panel
> 3. Expand Item Bake Settings panel

Each object in the List of Objects can have custom Bake Settings, including:

> - Material creation (create a material with all baked maps)
> - Internal/External output
> - Output directory and subfolder creation options for External save
> - Maps Batch naming (map naming keywords)
> - Bake device (CPU, GPU - depends on the system)
> - Adaptive sampling, sampling
> - And more

Inside the same Bake Settings panel, there are several important controls to know about:

> - Reset BakeMaster option (reset BakeMaster after bake)
> - Bake This Button (bake maps only for the current item in the List)
> - Bake All Button (bake maps for all items)

There is also an embossed field called "Bake Instruction". <br /> When you hover over it, you will see Baking process information and controls.

BakeMaster keeps track of all added maps and objects in a stack-like order:

> - Item0
>   - Map0
>   - Map1
> - Item3
>   - Map0
> - Item2
>   - Map0
>   - Map1

The order of classes can be changed using the <a href="https://bakemaster-blender-addon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workflow/interface/panel/list_of_objects_table.html#baking-order-buttons">order controls</a>. <br />Each class has its unique settings.

BakeMaster picks an Object added to the <a href="https://bakemaster-blender-addon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workflow/object/object.html#list-of-objects">List of Objects</a> and bakes maps added to it one by one. <br /> This process can be shown in the following diagram:

BakeMaster shows baking progress in the bottom info bar, in the style:

```
    Baking [Object Name]: [Map Name], map [Current Map Index] of [Length of Maps] ... [Map Baking Progress]
```
